## OVERVIEW <a id='overview'></a>

<p align="justify"> Established by the United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2009, the star rating is a system that helps people to make decisions in which nursing home the senior residents would reside. The decision process to choosing the right facility is not easy and soulwrenching. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, this system is a failure largely due to a lack of data audit and self-report bias. For example, the hypothesis testing is unable to confirm that number of COVID-19 deaths at five-star facilities are different from one-star facilities at the significance level (Silver-Greenberg and Gebeloff, 2021). The stipulation in this study that demonstrates this issue is that, implicitly, the CMS institution faces a crisis of decline in public trust. For that specific reason, the causal analysis is a linchpin in addressing this problem. </p>

## METHOD <a id='method'></a>

<p align ='justify'> In attempting to establish causal relationship, there are two different frameworks, which are data science and econometrics. The data science approach begins by searching patterns in the data in order to test model against data. But the role of econometrics is reversed. For example, the ecnometric approach begins by writing a causal model of economic behavior and its underyling assumptions, followed by determining whether the available data fits in the causal model. </p>
