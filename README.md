**[ ]** Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures is a downloadable list of more than 110,000 “publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.” Each vulnerability is assigned a unique identifier (e.g., CVE-2014-0160) and given a description. The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s National Vulnerability Database takes the list and adds more information for each entry, “such as fix information, severity scores, and impact ratings.” That database is available in a variety of bulk downloads and data feeds; you can also search it online.
