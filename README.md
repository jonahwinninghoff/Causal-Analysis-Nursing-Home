## OVERVIEW <a id='overview'></a>

There is clear evidence that the nursing home residents are particularly vulnerable to abandonment, neglect, exploitation, and abuse. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic holds the key metrics to reveal some answers, the rating of nursing-home services proves to be misleading. The technological challenge is to find more appropriate approaches supporting the decision-makers who want to send elders to nursing homes. This is the purpose of the data science project.
