**[ ]** An international team of researchers has created a dataset of 343 cities’ CO2 emissions. The researchers aggregated and standardized the emissions data — largely self-reported — from three sources: the Carbon Disclosure Project, the Bonn Center for Local Climate Action and Reporting, and a new project at Peking University. The dataset includes cities large and small, from Lagos and Shanghai to Kadıovacık, Turkey (pop. 216) and Brisbane, California (pop. ~4,700). In addition to emissions, the dataset also provides contextual information about the cities, such as average household sizes and gasoline prices.
