### OVERVIEW <a id='overview'></a>

There are three different possible ideas for the data science projects. Please select one of three projects that you think I should start with.

**[ ]** Automatic caption is unable to deal with specific terminology, which needs to be addressed. Sound classification algorithms can be useful to determine what topics they talk about. When being identified, the automatic caption can detect what kind of jargons they might use and incorporate them. This dataset is not available. But it can be created through web scraping. The data collection needs to be included.

**[ ]** Given that a poor response to COVID-19 pandemic has a deeper implication on economic level, the Census Bureauâ€™s data collection focusing on households affected by that pandemic can offer essential insights. For example, 20.8 million household renters were rental cost-burdened, which referred to at least 30% of their income going straight to rent. My objective as a data scientist is to expand more insights in this analysis.

**[X]** The vulnerable adults are at risk for being subject to abuse, neglect, exploitation, and abuse (ANEA). There are several cases occurring in nursing homes. The rating is unable to determine if ANEA occurs in these homes. But fortunately, the nursing homes are required to submit detailed payroll information plus files accounting for employee and contract hours. Perhaps, this investigation can offer some actionable insights to address this problem. There are key information plus datasets available below:
