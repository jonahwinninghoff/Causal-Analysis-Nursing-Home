'''
1.) Encipher 
  a.) Get any single string
  b.) Split them by each single letter, character or space
  c.) Coerce them into number using ord()
  d.) Use simple algebraic function: 7(x/10) = y
  e.) Coerce them into enciphered letters using chr()
  f.) Reverse the list
  g.) Coerce the list into string

2.) Decipher
  a.) Coerce string into the list
  b.) Reverse the list
  c.) Coerce the list into numeric list
  d.) Use the reverse algebraic function: x = 10*y/7
  e.) Use chr(), an inverse of ord()
  f.) Group all letters, characters, and spaces

Here is nothing but nighmarish. Being isolated is hell. Perhaps, to you, being isolated at home for one year seems easy. Being isolated for one year equals 4 million years. That is, the solitude turns into loneliness."
